Perl scripts
============

This is the location of the hashword perl scripts.

The first is hashword.pl which is used as a more secure method.  

The second is a hashword checker where you input your seed and can view the output to ensure that the seed and hashword are correct.

The ideal usage case is to use the hashword checker during an account creation or password change instance (where the user is not monitored) to ensure that the hashword generated is using the desired seed.

Subsequent hashword generations would be done with hashword.pl for privacy.
